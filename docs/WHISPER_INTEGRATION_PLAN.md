# Whisper.rn Integration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan and implementation details for integrating [Whisper.rn](https://github.com/mybigday/whisper.rn) into the AI Language Tutor app to enhance speech recognition capabilities with offline, high-accuracy speech-to-text functionality.

## What is Whisper.rn?

Whisper.rn is a React Native binding for OpenAI's Whisper automatic speech recognition (ASR) model. It provides:

- **Offline Speech Recognition**: Works without internet connection
- **High Accuracy**: Uses OpenAI's state-of-the-art Whisper models
- **Real-time Transcription**: Live audio processing capabilities
- **Multi-language Support**: Supports 99+ languages
- **Cross-Platform**: iOS and Android support
- **Core ML Optimization**: Enhanced performance on iOS devices

## Current Speech Architecture

Our app already has a robust speech recognition system using:

### Existing Dependencies
- `@react-native-voice/voice`: Native speech recognition
- `expo-speech`: Text-to-speech functionality
- `expo-av`: Audio recording and playback

### Current Type Definitions
Located in `src/services/speech/types.ts`:

```typescript
// Core interfaces already implemented
- SpeechRecognitionResult
- SpeechRecognitionError  
- SpeechRecognitionState
- SpeechRecognitionCallbacks
- SpeechRecognitionConfig
- TTSUtterance, TTSError, TTSState, TTSVoice
- UserLevel (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
- LevelBasedTTSConfig
```

## New Type Definitions Added

### Whisper-Specific Types

```typescript
// Whisper Model Types
export type WhisperModel = 'tiny' | 'tiny.en' | 'base' | 'base.en' | 'small' | 'small.en' | 'medium' | 'medium.en' | 'large';

// Configuration
export interface WhisperConfig {
  modelPath: string;
  language?: string;
  enableCoreML?: boolean;
  enableRealtime?: boolean;
  maxAudioLength?: number;
}

// Context and Results
export interface WhisperContext {
  transcribe: (audioPath: string, options?: WhisperTranscribeOptions) => Promise<WhisperResult>;
  transcribeRealtime: (options?: WhisperRealtimeOptions) => Promise<WhisperRealtimeSession>;
  release: () => Promise<void>;
}

export interface WhisperResult {
  result: string;
  segments?: WhisperSegment[];
  isCapturing?: boolean;
  processTime?: number;
  recordingTime?: number;
}

export interface WhisperSegment {
  start: number;
  end: number;
  text: string;
}
```

### Enhanced Recognition System

```typescript
// Engine Selection
export type SpeechRecognitionEngine = 'native' | 'whisper';

// Enhanced Configuration
export interface EnhancedSpeechRecognitionConfig extends SpeechRecognitionConfig {
  engine?: SpeechRecognitionEngine;
  whisperConfig?: WhisperConfig;
  fallbackToNative?: boolean;
}

// Capability Detection
export interface SpeechRecognitionCapabilities {
  supportsOffline: boolean;
  supportsContinuous: boolean;
  supportsConfidence: boolean;
  supportsWordTimestamps: boolean;
  maxLanguages: number;
  engine: SpeechRecognitionEngine;
}
```

## Integration Benefits for Language Learning

### 1. **Offline Pronunciation Practice**
- Students can practice pronunciation without internet connectivity
- Critical for users with limited data plans or poor connectivity
- Enables practice during travel or in remote areas

### 2. **Enhanced Accuracy for Assessment**
- Whisper's superior accuracy enables more precise pronunciation scoring
- Better detection of subtle pronunciation differences
- More reliable progress tracking and feedback

### 3. **Advanced Learning Features**
- **Word-level timestamps**: Enable precise pronunciation feedback
- **Confidence scoring**: More accurate assessment of speech quality  
- **Accent detection**: Better handling of various accents and speech patterns
- **Conversation practice**: More reliable real-time transcription for AI conversations

### 4. **Privacy and Security**
- All speech processing happens on-device
- No audio data sent to external servers
- Compliant with privacy regulations

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Basic Integration
1. **Install Whisper.rn**: `npm install whisper.rn`
2. **Add model management**: Download and manage Whisper models
3. **Create WhisperManager service**: Wrapper around Whisper.rn functionality
4. **Extend existing interfaces**: Use new type definitions

### Phase 2: Hybrid System
1. **Engine selection**: Allow users to choose between native and Whisper
2. **Fallback mechanism**: Auto-fallback to native if Whisper fails
3. **Performance optimization**: Smart model loading and caching
4. **User preferences**: Settings for engine selection and model size

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. **Pronunciation scoring**: Detailed pronunciation assessment using Whisper
2. **Real-time feedback**: Live pronunciation correction during exercises
3. **Progress analytics**: Enhanced metrics using improved accuracy
4. **Conversation mode**: AI conversation practice with reliable transcription

## Technical Considerations

### App Size Impact
- **Tiny model**: ~39MB additional app size
- **Base model**: ~142MB additional app size  
- **Small model**: ~244MB additional app size

**Recommendation**: Start with tiny.en model for English, add language-specific models as needed.

### Performance Impact
- **CPU Usage**: More intensive than native speech recognition
- **Battery Consumption**: Higher battery usage during active transcription
- **Memory**: Model loading requires significant RAM
- **Startup Time**: Initial model loading may add delay

### Platform Considerations

#### iOS
- **Core ML Support**: Enhanced performance with Apple's ML framework
- **Model Optimization**: Core ML models provide faster inference
- **Audio Session Management**: Proper integration with iOS audio system

#### Android
- **NDK Requirements**: Requires NDK version 24.0.8215888 or above
- **Proguard Rules**: Need to add keep rules for whisper.rn classes
- **Permission Handling**: Proper microphone permission management

## Dependencies to Add

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "whisper.rn": "^0.3.9"
  }
}
```

### Platform-Specific Setup

#### iOS Additional Setup
```bash
npx pod-install
```

Add to `ios/[APP_NAME]/Info.plist`:
```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires microphone access for pronunciation practice</string>
```

#### Android Additional Setup
Add to `android/app/proguard-rules.pro`:
```
# whisper.rn
-keep class com.rnwhisper.** { *; }
```

Add to `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:
